OK so how about this : light is at least two times faster than sound.

1 2 5 4 3 1 2

i seem to have intuitive speed as a heuristic in inifinitely derivable levels
yeah i'm good with harmonics

if you study grammar you understand log/exp_26 has a different shape
from log/exp_10 for instance.

I mean I have a way to describe a logical system as a continuously
derivable signal. I can un-flatline things. The functional space is
embedded in this continuously derivable signal. It can be arranged
into n-dimentional datasets. A three dimentional cloud with two light
source positions would be best for visualization.

Three times infinitely derivable gives access to notion of otherness
to readers of some parts of |R3. It gives an infinitely precise world
view to match every other aspect of two other infinitely precise world
views. So it could be said to represent perfect notions of truth,
recognition of truth, ego, recognition of ego, others, recognition of
others. In six directions.

For sale : barely used 3.5D linear exponential/logarithmic solver HPC
parallel computing, linear solver, 7 billion nodes, ...

Audio one has linear tone control (REPL) from exponential scale
frequencies. input can be extracted from air pressure levels by harmonic
analysis in the ear and cochlea.

Video one is linear half (1/2).

Two video one readers are coupled horizontally to add a sense of depth
and another high redudancy information channel.

So if audio
t0 0
t1 e(t1)
