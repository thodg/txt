We live and die to get all shit out of our heads.

She almost gives her life to give a clean brain to her child.
Pure waters, clean waters. Dead waters. Oxygen and hydrogen.

They gave their lives and failed :
 Thelot (jaw+neck bones grew lots of lymph nodes, tongue overgrow)
 Najnudel (left eye out of sync)

I tried to give them love and build a couple each time for a few years.

But they're full of shit. And they treat me badly for cleaning.
Broken sixes (6), aggressive and unwise behaviour,
corrupting your waters when you soak, recruiting for mayhem and war.

I'm done cleaning. Good luck with the apples respectful insight and
mindfullness.

Please potassium sorbate their asses hard.

I tried hard, Q6600 tried hard, {CKQ}BL is still full of shit in these
two houses, sorry. I would not be surprised should they not give birth
to a child. Human beings I tried to save and failed and will cry myself
about for my whole life.
