On the principles of inevitability
==================================

Future is by definition unknown.

However we can construct negative projections of inevitability principles.

So if you study the possibles you obtain a window frame on where you
need to be looking at for things to come real.
It might be double indirection. A lie within a lie. A gate within a gate.
A wheel within a wheel. Have you seen this somewhere ?

When the gates only lead to themselves you know everything is possible
and everything is at risk. I strive on this fear daily. It's hell.

When the gates build a thousand suns shining radio heat in between them,
you think that it's possible that everything is just everything and only
risk is fear but it's not really : it's hell also.

What I mean by hell is that you might never see the light ever again,
for whatever definition of what light might be to you. A permanent state
of realization that your data input is zeroed by things bigger than you.

At that point your best car is a fly one centimeter large at best.
We have to respect the fly, it's very good.
