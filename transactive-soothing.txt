OK we're at transactive soothing, how does she cope ?

it's ok we just apply the mystery of creation

now it's new

and soothing is old

to ourselves

---

it's perfect destruction of what whas before.

or you can lie about new.

the key is as poisonous as the cure

and forward we move, one for three

---

chemistry should be a warm place

breaking bad was right.

---

looking a bit like laura palmer now

by the seashore

and my fingernails do throw fine words dressed in black shea butter

hairy, heavy and mercury, war is the link to green coffee.

i /should/ be ready to die, meaning we're out of specs here.

---

i still wonder why you had to soothe the sun

and night is just a thief for everything i have and care about

to plate armours of embroidery

when did bored meet function is what we easily please

---

a terrible mistake

dynamics will hold us empire

we were pioneers hitting the bone piles for the sake of sound

---

a shape to shape the shape of flesh and bones

is a very reduced way to drive insane

why, let's shape the shape of shape.

And everything blurs meld !

However it did move !!

And the specs mean nothing anymore !!!

We changed !!!!

---

it has no name

both of every couple of things contrary

transcient gray of various sizes and places

the light frames it easy in transparent geodesics of soap

like a scream for life lost in a three stage forest

polyrhythms : the seashore. everyone can hear, 13, 69, 700, 800.

--

I'm done crying. Goodbye.
