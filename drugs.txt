They do not "sell" you drugs, they steal yours for being this stupid.
Like if guilt was their saviour. Scary.
Guilt + love is my only killer.

GO AWAY































A FEW PAGES BELOW IS ABOUT LEARNING WAYS TO KILL YOURSELF AND OTHERS

PLEASE GO AWAY
























































I know two deaths :
 One to kill for real, heroin you don't see them in the streets. they corrupt those who handle the dead.
 One to kill and keep the dead alive to kill more people with words and actions, cocaine you see in big cities they roam and hurt others stealing all money they possibly could. I saw a whole neighborhood of black people selling this in the heart of Paris, very organized, like "The Wire". They look at you and their faces say and your whole body understands : "I'll beat you to death if you do anything except give me money, take your thing, and go." I never saw again such cold blooded killers in my life.

I do not know other poisons lethal to human mind that they might take willingly. Ether maybe ? More a medical mistake than these two absolute perversions.

For these drugs to have such a strong effect on humans after so many generations we have to admit they play a central role in transmission of life and death. However they are completely above the human mind and cannot be used or controlled intelligently at all, even remotely, by them. You mess with death, death gets to know you.
