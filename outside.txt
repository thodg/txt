i could trust if she saw in xor out, that is true love
help find I/O we're all at a loss more or less

THE INTERNET IS NOT I/O UNTIL IT'S I/O
IT'S ALL REVERSIBLE UNTIL YOU CONFIRM IT SOMEWHERE

for me the internet is mostly postal I/O

do we still even like to receive letters ?
beyond advertisement, administration, commerce, social status change
do you still take time to write to anyone you know ?
what's your statistics in time series ?
can we trade it, please ? really we're good at this stuff !!!
Lettercoin. Ten coins emmited per kindly written postal letter sent to me. 1-1
Proof of transactional mental soothing. What a piece of work.

It's all dyadic and then it breaks at three. Always, everywhere.
It's all it does but then it ties some of them to read and write things.

A square, and a circle. Catch the light. All is said.
