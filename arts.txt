Arts are not really tropical, they carry their own lives as artforms
that passed through a few minds aroused enough to make it real.

otherwise we would see use of them as bare decoration for scientific content
like a metal version of pythagora's theorem is not really important

but no, it's like they argue against any decision more than anything else
like a sleeping beauty
