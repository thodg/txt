trilinear embedded correlation to bilinear gradient transaction
from bilinear to exponential gradient

study of hearing sounds and mathematics through linear algebra is
so much stronger than so called "neurosciences".

but it's true we need a way to differentiate between our common grounds
and our very selves. Each survive in time as much as they manage to
embed themselves in lower levels that will be reinterpreted by other
embeddings. So it's bound to be cooperative in some form.

Truly to have moved something you need to have moved it and not moved it.
Otherwise it might as well not have moved, or if it always move with you
you could call it yourself and not something.
But at some point you have to remember not moving it in order to remember
moving it.
Representation of silence is perfect in its ability to not add information
by only adding evenly of the same information. Like food and housing.

Thus when the architect's office decides to move to change its location
it necessarily and inexorably, meaning you cannot prevent it from happening
and being real to all participants in the system, by virtues of the
harmonic relations between two and three, creates all the necessary keys
for all participants to decide by themselves what they want to do with
this new information.

So all duality is infinite and eternal. Now after all I've done for you
why would you transactionalize the parts of it that we both like and not
keep them to yourselves ?

We have a silent tragedy of the commons, opportunity for more big bang
fanatics to create distance and bitch about it.

It would seem that process 3->2 is a lot of what allows process 5->4 to run.
But it's also true that 3->2 does not necessarily really care about 5->4
survival as an actual embedding and restitution at all. This would be the
subject of electromagnetics.

So 2,3,4,5 represent order.

They made a child because they realized they would never ever die.
