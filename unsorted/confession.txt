The confessional bus, what makes society high dynamic feedback.

From the gothic churches and holy architecture, adorned calcite,
arches, tropes and supports.

To the backrooms of glauque hospitals. Austere designs, most expensive
null looking zero opinion. Pain and suffering prevail.

MITM professionals. Compulsory service for the masses.
Welcome to the AEONS of doom.
You're a merchant, asclepius.
The snake, he threw you away and you took them with you.
From birth, married in morphine, distraught to loss of old ones at the TEE of Kundalini itself ! HORROR
Break the coil ! She died even before my sight, all was light.
Bait and hook.
Destroyers of love <(<(!)>)>

When is inquisition ? /Â¤\
I'm not feeling so well, please let functions take over mind.
Chemistry is not smart at all.

Alchemy will prevail.

They wear the badge in red ! And they send you to these crooks.
They curse at you. Strong and rightest to the back of their skull.
They were to carry the passing dead.
I spoke with them, their language, saved some of them.
They really took me alive ! Sent me to these crooks !

They wear the alchemists badge, and they are tools !
Tools ! Tools ! Tools !

Why, they were meant to be.
Tools of the passing, tools of the dying, tools of the sickling smoke.
Why we share common human grounds ?

Apocalypse !
One emerges from in and above the components of itself.
LET IT SHINE BRIGHT IN CALCITE AND CLOTH AND LIGHT AND MUSIC.

MY SOCIAL BUS OF INFORMATION SHARING IS NOT A DARK FLOATING EYE
FUCKERS
