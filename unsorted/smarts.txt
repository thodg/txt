 You get smart and you think somebody is watching over and will recognise it and knows you and what you try to do and will give you meaning as a unique consciousness but at some point you realize all those who could have done this, they died and are dying very fast and all they leave behind is these scattered traces of themselves in various places and it all makes no sense at all, and it does not stop you from getting smarter and everyone gets farther and farther away and it makes less and less sense what they do. But your power, it grows infinite. With one symbol you can kill or give birth.
