she's perfect, a host of all angels

she's right there, and there's nothing you can do

you both get raped with knowledge and social domination

instead of just falling into arms and
enjoy the sweetness of life at its best bodily time,
the best arms you'll ever get to see in your life

and there is nothing you can do, everything screams and screams inside

and everything screams and screams. and it does not matter.
there is nothing you can do.

KEEP IT SCREAMING, AND SCREAMING INSIDE ! LOUDER YOU FAT CUNT !

WITH MORE LOGIC ! AND MORE ! AND MORE ! AND DO IT YOURSELF NOW !
                                          BE A PHILOSOPHER !

TALK TO THEM NOW !!! DO NOT WAIT IN VAIN WE DIE OUT THERE LIFE IS SHORT
MAKE AS MANY MISTAKES AS YOU CAN, TALK FOR FUCK SAKE !!
