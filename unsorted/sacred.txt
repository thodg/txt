 Is it so often that you talk about the allmighty, sacred, divine powers of life and death and creation of the whole universe that you needed to reduce it to three fucking letters ?? What's wrong with you FFS ? Could you ensure they can have more than three letters or a syllab before giving them way to the allmighty sacred divine story book of yours ? Could you please define yourselves a little less cheap on the brains ?
 Oh it would seem now that New York did DSK as a religious threat to Hollywood and Los Angeles. Déjà qu'on en avait rien à foutre de ces trous du cul satanistes...

  The greeks had so much more to talk about.
   They had torah and built a huge host of divine images.
  Indians had so much more to talk about.
   Tantric secrets and vedic stories, puppets on tv.
  The north had so much more to talk about
   Elements and creatures

 They all had secrets and public stories :
  basic mathematics that require mighty life strength
  and a way to explain them to children with easy faces

 They built big empires of peace and doom with it.

 Divinity, temples, sacred.
  Mathematics, stories. Less hybrid, more ordered.
   Esoteric, public, intimate.
    For I, for all, for my friend.
