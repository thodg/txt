Oh why the sun ?
It seems random at first but it will blend in the end.
Definitely maybe.
Horizontal perspective fading in :
Rocks and small rocks. Water.
In the park, in summer, people playing freesbee.
Rocks and papers flying.
Tropical trees, very tall.
An ice cream.
Gellyfish symphony !
Sandals, a shovel and a pot.
Bernard l'hermite.
Leaves in the lake.
Smoke and fire. Beer bottles slowly melting in the fire.
A lake. Sit by a lake.
A deer with huge horns. A moose.
Lions fucking.
Dead cubs.
Sunscreen cream. Blue and orange.
A starfish. Another starfish. In water.
