If you understand addressing and encapsulation then you understand there is no one working memory. There is contextualized resonance on multivariate patterns that is locally accessible and serializable.

We have context with hierarchical filesystems.
Now we are clearly struggling with standard encapsulation and serialization to collaborate correctly and efficiently between legacy systems.

The operating system boundary will vanish and systems will be fully able to share and translate between representations of transactional systems to translate between grammars and semantics.
