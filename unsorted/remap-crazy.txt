So there is this nice operating system.

You have unified URI and URL to rule all I/O.

Now you have to specify SATA://pci/1:0/ to be automounted on
EXT4://b/ to make it work.

Mounting on a VFS seems to be about ignoring protocols.

Is there nothing wrong with mounting FTP and HTTP endpoints ?

Or is there some willingness to just remind us about HTTP
like an AD for a virus.

It's all a big time shared distributed vitual filesystem.
