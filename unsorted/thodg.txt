I'm a programmer.
So I tried to ditch the team, and company management.

Compared to a team of 3, one could think I'm 3 times slower.

But to communicate and think about some new idea I'm actually
faster than the whole team by a factor of fact(3), so in
this case 6. It will take 6 times more time for a team to
fully understand the necessary ramifications of a new concept
than for me, alone. Divided by 3 since they are 3 means I will
be 2 times faster than each one of them. That is because they
need to communicate and aggregate parts of the ideas they
manipulate to each other.

And so that would mean that Java development can be made slower
by adding people to the project.

And to learn I'm less disturbed so I can do a lot of reading.

I got more and more time to discern for myself what are powerful
abstractions and what is total fluff in the modern computing industry.

I'm a pretty good Lisper now.

That is how I translated the literal phrase "beating the average".
Actually start ups are beating 1/FIB, and they do it easily.
