In order to address all intellectual property of public image
individuals who want to acertain the authenticity of the photos
they make, we have developped bio-watermark, a new and innovative
way of watermarking your photos directly with your own skin.

Do not try this at home. To prepare your bio-watermark, just
cook an android phone or an iphone with the bio-watermark
application installed. Just hack it with a hammer to let the
fresh taste come out and let it simmer in warm water (50Â°C)
for two hours. Filter out the electronic components and serve.
