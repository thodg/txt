I'm sure, convinced by intuition, observation and feeling of persecution
from researchers, that binary data can only represent one bit plus or minus
sqrt(2) of real space as we know it, for any value of sqrt(2).
More precision means more space.

Space is expanding because we are all trying to explain systems
by means of their smaller components. It's easier to look inside things.

However when there is time, the small things might lose track of how they
build the whole system, so for complex things, other equally complex things
are often better than small things. System dynamics is the adequate tool.
