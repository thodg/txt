Cryptography. The name of the why when.

"We're all to pass this gate to feel safe !"
ADD SSL EVERYWHERE, FEEL THE SAFERY, YUM ! !

How safe can we be ourselves when cleartext is not deemed enough to be safe ?
Should we encrypt processes too ? And write encrypted code ?

I mean with VLANS and real time redundant virtual routers who cares about cryptography anymore.

The only true difference is wether the routing of packets has a log
embedded. Can you debug the essence of power publicly signing its evil
deeds. I need to know what you call knowing.

At some point, things just work, or they don't. SSL works, but cleartext
works fairly well too in a sane computer environment and puts a lot less
pressure on the CPU. I need to know, why is cleartext not good enough ?
As a law. Be a cleartext person, please.
