On the ideological side of things :
 Monarchists feed capitalists.
 Capitalists feed communists.
 Communists feed anarchists.
 Anarchists rule silently.
 Anarchists kill monarchists.
 Communists kill anarchists.
 Capitalists kill communists.
 Monarchists rule silently.

Back and forth, rince and repeat.
400 years long cycles as 50 years pass in between each generation.
Silent rule cleans all family memory and war memory.

System dynamics can get you out of that loop.
