 Olivier Thomas, Drome, France. Proposed kernel review.
  RX with low voltage by ITA8 and me, but stopped working after 30 minutes
  TSX at POR8 by him
  afterwards i got allergic but really both ITA8 and I broke two AT6 to add support for end users.
  a few years later i was recontacted but ended in plonk because of disagreements over SCO and origins of Lisp, mostly politics.


 Thibault Reuille, with overstated support for wine, mostly reading. California, USA.
  only provided directory listings, one reached far north.
  still owes me money.


 Actual teachings by CIB itself on internet.
  their end users actually mostly play wargames and self destruction.
  their deployment of enlightenment mostly sucks goats.


 Thanks for all the fish. I hope I will see these guys again whole maybe.
  I'm not hungry at all. However I still keep a lot of disk space for them.
