 I won't work for money for programming.
  It's just no use, and stupid.
   It does not scale, it does not work.
    It just makes people do stupid and stupider things.
     They ask me to make stupid and stupider things.
      They want me to write it in stupid and stupider language.
       I won't ever again obey programming industry.

 Yet I want to pay programmers to do things.
  We see ourselves poor, crawling "better" and lose *good* time and again.
  I want it backwards for useful things to remain.
  I won't go for shit programming languages like python and ruby.
  I'm not completely happy with C nor CL.
   The world sucks.

 I think maybe computers stopped making actual progress for humans since 2006. Just how shitty can the equator line become.
