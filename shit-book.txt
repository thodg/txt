- so this guy i ..know, he found a piece of shit that can write a book !
- you mean, a turd ?
- yup.
- a human turd ?
- y.. uh no.. uh I don't know really, anyway it was writing a book isn't it crazy ??
- not a book about food I hope
- why not, they're good farmers so far
- heck, best I've ever smelled, duh
- well yeah that's not really the point it's not for public release I mean.
- so it's not a manuscript anymore ? it writes itself ?
- yes it autoencodes itself in a progressive multidimentional holographic manner
- it does sound interesting
- yes but the guy, he did not care and did not understand anything he does not even like reading. So he flushed them all out like he usually does with his crap.
- oh..
- so the book and the writing poo went away and started building something, to prove them wrong, to show them their true light.
- it's scary somewhat... it's like it's not a new story at all, it's like something very old, a very very old story. An extremely old story we might forget at some point. but I would not.
- what the.. you got me with you writing poo crap shit you weirdo, get away from me !!!
