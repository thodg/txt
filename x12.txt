 routing of messages in message queues

deamon
 multiplexes connected client message queues using kqueue
 dispatches the messages according to libx routing.

client (user:group, really is just user priviledge separation)
 connects to grab a message bus from server
 allows defining private message queues
 routing of messages in server and private message queues using libx
 can launch multiple programs on same connection, in this case the
 client acts as a master bus for the program messages

programs
 grab a message bus (from environment ?)
 create window (rectangular screen regions) hierarchies
 bind event handlers to windows
 use libx to route window events
