2018: Le café bleu n'existe toujours pas.

---

I still do not know how to program graphics and audio code. No good language.
Candidates by order of ease of programming.
 Basic sucks it's mamma's tits, not mine.
 C is too verbose, no rational types.
 Do has no compiler. I might make it happen with X persons and Y years.
 D is too verbose, no rational types.
 Most Lisp are garbage collected and do not really differenciate static types from dynamic types.
 ML languages are garbage collected and are plain ugly, sorry.
 JS is garbage collected and hard to write (harder than C and CL, maybe not C++) and has no static binary types.
 C++ is too verbose, half assed rational types, crippling operators.
 Java is not targeting the hardware I work on, great idea guys come again. Oh make it a phone, hahaha. Truly, go fuck yourselves.
 /bin/sh, for the tits.
 Sed and awk look good now.
 perl ?
  
 at some point it should produce assembly for a hardware platform 
  the more I learn the more despair  
  
It's like it's made to be impossible to do with only one grammar.
I do not see the point in that.
