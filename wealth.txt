Wealth of a system is both the amount of convoluting inner interfaces of this system and its ability to provide a live image of the totality of these inner interfaces to other systems, identical or not, mechanical or living, adverse or friend. This is para meta genomics, the big topic of the big book of dead children I guess.

Each system can represent wealth of other systems to make sense of it. Most linear models like "wealth is market price" tend to fail eaten both by competent traders and/or their own non-linearity. That's what *multifractal analysis* means. It means every measure might have been measured against a non-linear axis of development and it says to take that into account but not as part of the signal but to account it under measurement systems. So if you had rigged some neural network (or linear algebra models, its almost the same), to your signal you have one layer of linear combinations of that signal, but to take into account the non-linearity or at least measurement of the signal space itself you need another layer of linear combinations. So below two layers of linear combinations (neurons, perceptrons, matrices) you can get no understanding of emergent multi-agent systems.
