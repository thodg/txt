So you help them, build a world, of peace and freedom,
of fake war, of segregated amusement.

And one day you realize :
They cannot count for shit.
And they think they teach you.
And they think they bought you.
And they think they rule.
Their numbers always wrong.

Commerce is dropping fast.

And they think they can reproduce.
And they think they can steal without knowing.
And they think they will avoid wars.
Because of love.

I'll destroy everything you had, stupid girl.
For the numbers are naught but my friends who died before me.
Before my very eyes, they followed and fell.
And none slowing for them, to catch a breathe.

To catch a fire. In the wind. Numbers.
To catch a war. In the economy. Numbers.
To catch a cold. In the body. Numbers.

But when I see her I know I'm wrong.
YET YOU FAIL AT TWENTY AND TWO ALWAYS.
DO WE HAVE TO KILL YOU ALL AND START AGAIN ?
